# Utility Billing Parser

## ðŸ’¡ Description and Technical Details

This application is designed to automate the process of extracting billing data from utility company websites.  The system uses **Selenium** and **WebDriver** to navigate and interact with web pages, logging in with provided credentials. 

After logging in, it classifies links into categories like **account**, **billing**, and **usage**. It then sequentially loads each classified URL to parse HTML content and JSON network call responses, ultimately extracting user data. The current implementation is **synchronous**, but future plans include introducing **asynchronous** processing and **batching** of users for improved efficiency. Error handling and retry mechanisms are planned for a later design phase.

## ðŸš€ How to Run the Application

To run the application, follow these steps:

1.  Clone the implementation from this repo.
2.  If you're targeting a different utility, you'll need to modify lines 17-24 in the `project.py` file to accommodate the new site.
3.  Replace USERNAME and PASSWORD in `project.py` with the PSE utility credentials. Replace API key with Zhila's gemini API key.
3.  Execute `project.py` locally. Note that the application relies on the Gemini API key, which is linked to a specific Google Cloud project. This may require additional configuration.
4.  Once running, results can take some time. This is because of the Gemini API. It should take about a minute to process.

## ðŸ”Œ How to Use with a Different Utility

To adapt the application for a new utility, you must update the core logic in `project.py` (specifically lines 17-24). This is where the application's WebDriver and login routines are configured to handle the specific structure of a new utility's website.

The following is an example of the kind of data the application extracts after parsing a utility's website.
